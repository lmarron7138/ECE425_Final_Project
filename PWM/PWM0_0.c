 * This file contains the function definitions for the PWM0_0 driver.
 * It uses the Module 0 PWM Generator 0 to generate a PWM signal using the PB6 pin.

 * @note This driver assumes that the system clock's frequency is 50 MHz.
 *
 * @note This driver assumes that the PWM_Clock_Init function has been called
 * before calling the PWM0_0_Init function.
